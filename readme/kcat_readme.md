kafkacat is one of my go-to tools when working with Kafka. Itâ€™s a producer and consumer, but also a swiss-army knife of debugging and troubleshooting capabilities. So when I built a new Fedora server recently, I needed to get it installed. Unfortunately thereâ€™s no pre-packed install available on yum, so hereâ€™s how to do it manually.

Note
kafkacat is now known as kcat (ref). When invoking the command you will need to use kcat in place of kafkacat.
Pre-requisite installs ðŸ”—
Weâ€™ll need some packages from the Confluent repo so set this up for yum first by creating /etc/yum.repos.d/confluent.repo:
```shell
[Confluent.dist]
name=Confluent repository (dist)
baseurl=https://packages.confluent.io/rpm/5.4/7
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.confluent.io/rpm/5.4/archive.key
enabled=1

[Confluent]
name=Confluent repository
baseurl=https://packages.confluent.io/rpm/5.4
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.confluent.io/rpm/5.4/archive.key
enabled=1
Now install the dependencies:
```
# Update yum
```shell
sudo yum update -y
```

# Install build tools
```shell
sudo yum group install "Development Tools" -y
```
# Install librdkafka and other deps
```shell
sudo yum install -y librdkafka-devel yajl-devel avro-c-devel
```

Build kafkacat ðŸ”—
Pull down the kafkacat repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat.git
cd kafkacat
```
Prepare the install - make sure that this step does not result in an error!
```shell
./configure
```

If you get errors here, itâ€™s off to Google you go to try and figure them out, because thereâ€™s no point continuing if you canâ€™t. You might find some failed steps that donâ€™t result in an actual error - this is a "soft fail" and means that certain functionality wonâ€™t be available in the kafkacat that you install (in this case, Avro/Schema Registry). Hereâ€™s an example of one:

checking for serdes (by pkg-config)... failed
checking for serdes (by compile)... failed (disable)
Install! ðŸ”—
```shell
make
sudo make install
```

Check that it works:
```shell
âžœ kafkacat -V

Test it:
```shell

This all seems like too much hassle? ðŸ”—
Yeah, thatâ€™s why Docker was invented ;-)

If you want to run kafkacat but canâ€™t get it installed, do not fear! You can run it anyway:

docker run --rm edenhill/kafkacat:1.5.0 \
kafkacat -V
You just need to make sure you wrap your head around Docker networking if you do this, because localhost to a Docker container is not the same (by default) as localhost on your host machine:

âžœ docker run --rm edenhill/kafkacat:1.5.0 \
kafkacat -b localhost:9092 -L
% ERROR: Failed to acquire metadata: Local: Broker transport failure
If you add --network=host then it will use the network as if executing locally:

âžœ docker run --rm --network=host edenhill/kafkacat:1.5.0 \
kafkacat -b localhost:9092 -L

Metadata for all topics (from broker 3: localhost:9092/3):
